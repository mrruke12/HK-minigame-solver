# Automating Mini-Games in Hamster Kombat Using C++

This C++ script automates the solving of mini-games from Hamster Kombat by utilizing two local HTML files to input initial grid data and visualize the solution.

## How to Use

Before the first run, configure the necessary parameters in the `config.exe` file as follows:

1. Specify the size of the square grid (default: 6 x 6).
2. Set the maximum number of steps for the solution (default: 36).
3. Provide the path to your browser's downloads folder.
4. Define the winning position of the key (default: 4252).

Once the configuration is complete, proceed with the following steps to run the program:

1. Launch `main.exe`.
2. The script will automatically open the `picker.html` file. Here, you can set obstacles by clicking on the start and end points, which will create the obstacles automatically. Note that the first obstacle is always designated as the key obstacle. If you make a mistake when placing an obstacle, simply refresh the browser page to start again.
3. After configuring the grid to your satisfaction, click the button below to send the data to the script.
4. Wait for 5-10 seconds as the script processes the information. It will then automatically open `visualiser.html`, where you can see the solution by clicking the two buttons below.

Upon completion, the script will close. If `visualiser.html` does not open automatically, it may indicate that the solution could not be found within the maximum number of steps specified in `config.ini` (consider increasing this value) or that a valid solution does not exist (please check your grid setup).

## How to Compile

The compilation process is straightforward and requires no special considerations. Ensure that the compiled executable is placed in the same folder as the `config.ini` file and the `visualiser` folder. Please note that the script does not generate `config.ini` or visualizer files.

## About the Visualiser Folder

The `visualiser` folder contains both Picker and Visualiser files, which can be used separately:

- **Picker**: This file is utilized for creating the desired grid, which is exported as a text file upon clicking the button. Each created obstacle's coordinates are printed to the console; you can view this in your browser's developer tools.
  
- **Visualiser**: This file is used for visualizing the solution generated by the script. You can manually adjust the data for the Visualiser by editing the first two lines of `code.js`.
